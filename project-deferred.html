      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
      This project had two main goals: creating a hybrid Entity-Component /
      Entity-Component-System engine, and displaying graphics with a
      deferred rendering pipeline. The majority of this work was inspired
      by <a href="https://liamtyler.com">Liam Tyler</a>'s work with his <a
            href="https://github.com/LiamTyler/Progression">Progression</a>
      engine.

      This project was implemented in <a href="https://rustup.rs">Rust</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Hybrid EC/ECS engine</li>
        <li>User camera control</li>
        <li>3 rendering types:
          <ol>
            <li>Forward</li>
            <li>Deferred</li>
            <li>Deferred with light volumes</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
      One of the largest challenges we encountered in this project was working
      with globally static objects, such as the GLFW window, and the rendering
      system. Rust is naturally memory-safe, which makes dealing with static
      objects like this rather difficult. I ended up using macros to simplify
      the interface into the engine's main components.
      </p>

      <p>
      Another challenge was getting the resulting images from the three
      rendering types to look similar. We ended up using some hacks to get the
      lighting to look correct for each individual rendering model. We hope to
      resolve in the near future.
      </p>

      <h2>Controls</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>WASD/Mouse:</strong> Camera control</li>
        <li><strong>r:</strong> Cycle rendering modes (forward, deferred,
          deferred + light volumes)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Implementation Details</h2>

      <p>
      We loosely followed the Entity-Component-System architecture to
      implement the engine.

      <p>
      Once the basic ECS engine was in place, the next phase of the project
      was creating a deferred rendering pipeline. Deferred rendering can be
      desirable in situations where one has scenes with many lights. Deferred
      can avoid excessive per-pixel light calculations, and light volumes can
      help reduce the number of computations even further. Deferred rendering
      works by saving scene information into textures &endash; referred to
      here as the "G Buffer." The G Buffer contains textures for normals,
      diffuse color, and specular.

      </p>

      <p>
      The last piece of this project was implementing light volumes. This
      technique is an extension of deferred rendering. Each light has an
      effective radius, which corresponds to the distance at which the light
      intensity is below a small threshold.
