      <h1>CSCI 8980 Project 1: Simple Game</h1>

        Game!</a>

      <h2>Gameplay / Game Design</h2>

      <p>
        This game is vaguely based on a balloon-tap style game, where the goal
        is to pop the balloons that appear on the screen. I chose a Star Trek
        theme for the game, where the player is the <em>Enterprise</em>, and the
        "balloons" are Borg Cubes. The user clicks the destination for the
        <em>Enterprise</em>, and it follows a Bezier curve to get to its
        destination. The user presses space to fire photon torpedoes at the Borg
        ships. The game is implemented in <a href="https://p5js.org">p5.js</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This game is designed as a free-for-all style game, where you have
        unlimited photon torpedoes, and the Borg ships don't shoot back at the
        player's ship. One nice thing to make gameplay more fun could be to add
        a level manager so different enemies could spawn with different tactics.
      </p>

      <h2>Algorithmic Discussion</h2>

      <h3>Features:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Simple Entity-Component architecture</li>
        <li>Smooth player movement based on Bezier curves</li>
        <li>Transform hierarchy</li>
        <li>Timing system</li>
        <li>Simple collision system</li>
        <li>Damage system</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The two key algorithmic portions of this game were Bezier curves for
        smooth player movement, and transform parents.
      </p>

      <p>
        De Casteljau's algorithm was used to find points along a cubic Bezier
        curve. The first and last control points are the current position, and
        the mouse click location, respectively. The second point in the curve is
        a set distance in front of the ship's current position along the ship's
        current heading, to give the illusion of the ship having a "turning
        radius." The third point is two-thirds along the way between the initial
        ship position and the mouse click, plus an offset in the direction
        orthogonal to the vector between those points.
      </p>

      <p>
        Initially, I didn't believe that it was going to be necessary to create
        my own transform class. However, p5.js does not support matrices, so I
        ended up creating my own transform mechanism that uses a hybrid of my
        own <code>Matrix3x3</code>s and <code>p5.Vector</code>s. This transform
        mechanism supports transform parents, which enable the ship to have a
        photon torpedo launcher "mounted" on it. I implemented my own naive
        matrix multiplication, and global transform application. One thing I
        wasted a lot of time on for this particular problem was the fact that in
        2D, p5 uses <strong>clockwise</strong> rotations, and my code was trying
        to use counterclockwise ones.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, a simple health/damage system was created for dealing
        damage to enemy ships from photon torpedoes. The damage system alters
        the rendered image of the Borg cube according to how much damage has
        been dealt to it:
      </p>

      <ul class="tiled-list">
        <li><img src="./assets/project-2dgame/borg3.jpg"> 100% Health</li>
        <li><img src="./assets/project-2dgame/borg3_damage1.jpg"> 75% Health</li>
        <li><img src="./assets/project-2dgame/borg3_damage2.jpg"> 50% Health</li>
        <li><img src="./assets/project-2dgame/borg3_damage3.jpg"> 25% Health</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        One of the current bottlenecks is definitely object collision. Currently
        there is an O(n^2) algorithm in place for checking collisions between
        photon torpedoes and Borg ships. Performance on collisions could be
        drastically improved by using a spatial data structure.
      </p>

      <h2>Game Engine Analysis</h2>

      <p>
        It would have been incredibly helpful if p5 had native support for
        matrices and transformations. However, I will say that it was incredibly
        useful to learn about the process of applying transform parents, and all
        the things that can go wrong during that process.
      </p>

      <p>
        Key components in my p5-based 2D rendering engine were inspired by
        the Unity game engine, and include an Entity-Component architecture,
        several systems for managing game state, and the transform hierarchy.
      </p>

      <p>
        The developer creates <code>GameObject</code>s, which each have
        <code>component</code>s. Each component is a short segment of code
        which specifies behaviors that each object should have. For example,
        the <em>Enterprise</em> has a <code>FollowMouseBehaviour</code>
        component, which tells the ship to follow an interpolated Bezier
        spline to the location where the user has clicked, and the photon
        torpedo launcher has a <code>RotateToMouse</code> component, which
        makes sure the photon torpedoes are always launched in the direction
        of the mouse. The static <code>GameObjectManager</code> keeps track
        of all active game objects, and handles all game object instantiation
        and destruction. All game objects and components have access to the
        <code>GameObjectManager</code>, which enables them to directly
        interact with other game objects (as is necessary in the case of
        photon torpedo and Borg interaction).
