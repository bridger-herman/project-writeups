      <h1>CSCI 8980 Project 2: Large Scenes</h1>

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        The goal for this assignment was to extend an existing game engine to
        incorporate large scene rendering functionality, such as view frustum
        culling and level of detail. The base game engine is GEFS (Game Engine
        From Scratch), created by
        <a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~sjguy/">Stephen J. Guy.</a>
      </p>

            the Trex.obj file and the torus we created in Blender). A
            subdivision surface was applied to each model to smooth it out.
            Without any speedups, the average framerate for this scene was 2.5
            FPS on a 2014 Lenovo Ideapad with an NVIDIA GT 730M.

      <h2>Implementation Details</h2>

      <h3>Debug Camera</h3>
      <p>
          An independently-controlled debug camera is supported, which allows the
          user to inspect the scene from a different perspective. The main camera
          view frustum, and optionally each object’s bounding radius can be drawn
          when the user is in debug mode. To achieve this, a separate "UserCamera"
          class was created, which encapsulates all the matrix math for the view
          and projection matrices, as well as the view frustum calculations for
          each camera. To switch which camera the user is seeing from, they can
          press 'z'. While viewing from the debug camera, the user can control
          their position with standard 'wasd' control.  They can also control
          their Y position by pressing Shift+W or Shift+S. The normal camera can
          still be moved with the arrow keys while viewing from the debug
          camera.

      <h3>Hierarchical Radius Calculations</h3>

      <p>
        Each model (parent and children) has two radii stored. This is because
        rather than hardcoding a radius for each object in the Prefab.txt
        file, we decided to automate the process. Each object (defined here as
        a model that has an object file) has its base radius, which is
        calculated automatically based on the maximum distance from each
        vertex in the object to the center of the model. This radius risks
        being larger than necessary if the model is not centered, but will
        never be too small. This radius can basically be thought of as the
        base size of the object model. However, models may need a second
        radius to handle translations and/or scaling (rotations do not matter
        since we are working with a circle detection system). As such, each
        model stores a final radius that represents its actual size after
        transformations. In addition, this grabs the largest size between
        itself and its children—so a model without an object file will have a
        final radius of its largest child. Figure 6 below illustrates this
        system in a simplified manner, with the black dot representing the
        origin.
      </p>

      <figure>
          <img src="./assets/project-large-scenes/radius-calc.png">
        <figcaption>
            Hierarchical radius calculation
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
          An important thing to note is that even though the final picture has
          doubled the size of each of its components, the circle and square still
          have their radius from before they were put into a larger object.
          Because a model can exist on its own and as a child of one or more
          things, the only stored information is that which is always true—its
          size based on itself and its own children. As such, when we need the
          object radius for things such as view frustum culling and LOD, we use
          the final radius multiplied by any scaling that has happened by its
          parents.
      </p>

      <p>
          There are a couple oddities of this system worth calling out. First off,
          we assume prefabs are centered around the origin. If we wanted just the
          translated circle above, it would operate with a radius of two even
          though its actual radius just needs to be one. This means that if we
          want an object to be translated while remaining the same size, we should
          do this in the creation of the object in the main.lua file. The second
          oddity is with object files. We discovered that some object file radius
          calculations were not happening correctly—the dinosaur, for example, has
          a number of child objects but only one has a radius that is greater than
          zero. This caused unnatural culling, which will be explained in the next
          section.

      </p>

      <h3>View Frustum Culling</h3>

      <p>
          The view frustum for each camera was calculated from the camera’s
          attributes: position, up, direction, field of view, aspect ratio, near
          plane, and far plane. Cross products were used to create the normals for
          each plane of the frustum, and these planes were tested against the
          position and radius of each object in the scene.
      </p>

      <figure>
          <img src="./assets/project-large-scenes/frustum-diagram.png">
        <figcaption>
            Camera view frustum diagram
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
          If objects were not in the view frustum, they and their children would
          not be drawn. More specifically, the draw method would not even be
          called for their children—this allowed us a hacky sort of object
          grouping that could also function as a spatial data structure. In our
          DinoHat example, we have two main objects: the dinosaur and the torus
          hat. If the parent model was determined to be culled, we would not check
          to see if the dinosaur or the torus needed to be culled (because they
          obviously would be).
      </p>

      <p>
          Due to the nature of our cumulative hierarchical radius system, we can
          create models that represent a chunk of space. If none of that area is
          on the screen, then we no longer need to check individual components. If
          that area is on the screen, then we check each of its child objects to
          see if they are on the screen. This, again, functions as a spatial data
          structure! But it does require the creator of the prefab file to group
          things accordingly, as randomly grouping objects that are far away would
          create a radius so large it would get rid of any potential benefit.
      </p>

        <li><img src="./assets/project-large-scenes/culling.png"> With View
            Frustum Culling (15 fps)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
          As mentioned in the previous section, the radius for objects from object
          files were sometimes being set incorrectly. As such, the code mistakenly
          believed that some parts of the dinosaur were smaller than they were and
          would cull them even when they remained on the screen (leading to one of
          our favorite bugs, in which only the dinosaur’s teeth would remain). As a
          hacky way around this, we always draw models that have the string ".obj"
          somewhere in them if the code reaches them. Again, the code will never
          try to draw them if the parent object is entirely off the screen,
          allowing this method to successfully solve the problem without causing
          much overhead.
      </p>

      <h3>Level Of Detail</h3>

      <p>
          The LOD system we implemented is pretty simple, though it took a long
          time to make the design decisions for it. To determine the distance
          between the model and the camera, we simply use the distance between the
          camera position and model position, minus the radius of the model. An
          object can have LOD distance in which it switches from drawing its high
          LOD children to its low LOD children. Each model stores one of three LOD
          values (represented by an enum): always, low, or high. When a model is
          determining which of its children to draw, it always draws the children
          that are marked “always”. If the parent is closer than the LOD distance
          it has stored, it draws its children that are marked “high”, otherwise
          it draws the ones that are marked “low”. This system could easily
          support more LOD (such as “medium”), so long as there exist different
          models. However, we did not implement any sort of auto-decimator and
          thus we are reliant on having models of different quality.
      </p>

      </ul>

      <h3>High Level Analysis</h3>

      <p>
          All of our systems lead to improvements in the runtime of our code. The
          radius system does slow the start up of the code and inputting hardcoded
          radii into the prefab document may have been faster, but would have
          required more work per object and likely would have been less accurate.
          When the user wants to look at the entire scene, the level of detail
          makes a much larger difference than view frustum culling as nothing
          needs to be culled. In fact, in this situation, the view frustum culling
          slows down the program since it runs all the calculations to see if an
          object should be shown without saving any rendering time. For the most
          part, however, view frustum culling makes a larger difference because
          the user will generally be in the middle of the scene. The ability to
          not render certain models at all makes a huge difference in runtime. The
          LOD system does require more work to be put into setting up the prefabs
          and is also somewhat limited: a model cannot exist as low poly in one
          situation and high poly in another, something that could be desired but
          we decided was overly complicated for most scenarios. However,
          especially in situations where an incredibly high poly model may be
          wanted at close distances only, our LOD system allows for that potential
          and opens up doors from an artistic point of view. Of course, LOD by
          definition means that some models have less detail and, when not set up
          well, can cause a noticeable decline in rendering quality. Overall,
          however, all of our methods are necessary in order to have an acceptable
          FPS!
