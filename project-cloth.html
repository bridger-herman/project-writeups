      <h2>Simulations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Regular cloth (flag)</li>
        <li>Deformable objects</li>
        <li>Polyphonic synthesizer (partially implemented)</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        The largest challenges of this project have been determining
        if the simulation is "correct" or not. With the first part of the
        simulation, I made the mistake of not taking into account forces from
        all directions on nodes, which resulted in the springs not responding
        to forces in physically realistic ways. An additional challenge was working
        on the physically-based sound simulation. Due to the way that the rest of
        my simulation was implemented, the update speed on the nodes was not fast
        enough to use their velocity for realtime audio.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Another challenge that I encountered during the course of this project was
        texturing the flags correctly. The first hurdle to get over was correctly
        assigning the texture coordinates based on each vertex (Node) position. I
        was fairly certain that I had a working model for how the textures would
        work, but the texture was still completely garbled. It turns out that when
        using a square mesh, the texture should also be square. I started out using
        the New Zealand flag with its original aspect ratio, but then squashed it
        down to a square image to make the texture work properly.

          </ul>
  
          <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
          <h3>Simulation Overview</h3>
          <p>
            The first step when the simulation is run is to build the cloth
            programmatically. A start position is given to the Cloth constructor, and
            it creates Node objects in a gridded pattern to store positions and
            velocities, and builds an accompanying adjacency list. The link and cloth
            renderers use this adjacency list to determine where to draw
            <code>GL_LINES</code> and <code>GL_TRIANGLES</code>, respectively. This
            adjacency list is also used when calculating the forces acting upon each
            node.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Each time through the main event loop, the cloth is updated 10 times with a
            fixed `dt = 0.001`. This was to prevent the simulation from blowing up, and
            to still display realistic results. Inside the cloth update, the following
            steps occur:
            <ol>
              <li>All forces become `F = m_{\text{node}}*a_{\text{gravity}}`</li>
              <li>Spring forces (`k_{\text{spring}}` and `k_{\text{damp}}`) are added</li>
              <li>Drag forces from the cloth area are applied</li>
              <li>Integration (Eulerian) is performed (velocities and positions are updated)</li>
              <li>Each node is updated</li>
              <li>The cloth and link renderers are updated</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
  
          <p>
            After all updates are finished, the cloth is drawn and the scene rendered.
          </p>
  
          <h3>Deformable Object Simulation</h3>
          <p>
            The deformable objects that were created in this simulation are very similar
            to the mass-spring cloth system described above. They follow the same
            general principles, only extended into a third dimension. Instead of only
            rows and columns for a cloth, there are now rows, columns, and slices for
            a deformable object. Initially the deformable objects were created with no
            cross springs, which resulted in the object becoming a pancake as soon as it
            hit the ground. After discovering this, cross springs were added along all
            of the pricipal axes of the object, resulting in a much stronger object.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            The deforable object spawns in the air, anchored from the nodes in its top
            slice. Once the <code>t</code> key is pressed, the object is released from
            its anchors and falls freely until it hits the ground, and/or is acted upon
            by the wind. Node collisions with the ground are done naively, assuming that
            it is a plane located at 0.0 on the y axis.
          </p>
  
          <h3>Simulated Musical Instrument</h3>
          <p>
            I attempted to create a simulated musical instrument using the same concepts
            as the main cloth simulation, with the added component of realtime audio. I
            was never able to get a fully working audio simulation. I am fairly
            convinced that the cause is that the update method of the string takes too
            long to update each Node's velocity, resulting in audio that doesn't
            actually reflect the vibrations of the string in realtime. When I have more
            time, I'd definitely like to come back to this simulation and try again to
            make it work properly.
          </p>

            <h3>Force Calculations</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Spring Forces:</strong> The spring forces within the cloth are
              calculated using a dampened version of Hooke's Law: `F_\text{spring} =
              k_{\text{spring}}*((x_1 - x_0) - x_{\text{rest}}) + k_{\text{damp}}*(v_1 -
              v_0)`. The forces are applied in opposite directions at each end of the
              spring.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              <strong>Drag Force:</strong> The drag force is calculated using a modified
              version of Rayleigh's drag equation: `F_\text{aero} = -\frac{1}{2} \rho
              |\mathbf{v}|^2 c_\text{drag} a \mathbf{n}`. The normal of each quad is
              calculated using the cross product of two of its edges.
            </p>
