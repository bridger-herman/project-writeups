      <h1 id="csci-5607-homework-4">CSCI 5607 Homework 4 -
        Maze Game</h1>

      <p>You know what they say &emdash; that you'll dislike the first
      graphics engine that you create? Well, this homework proved to be no
      different. I set out with the goal of making an
      Entity-Component-System graphics framework in Rust and then completing
      the assignment using the framework.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, real life rarely works out as nice as our goals
      might suggest. After sinking about 30 hours into trying to get an
      extensible ECS working, I decided to pull the plug on it for the
      purposes of actually finishing the assignment. The start of the
      framework I made can be seen in <code>src/graphics_framework</code>,
      but after I pulled the plug I definitely broke encapsulation between
      the game logic and the framework.</p>

      <p>I chose to use a <em>Star Trek</em> theme for this game - enjoy!
      All models and textures (except the <a

        <li>
          Texture map the walls and floors
        </li>

          Use models to represent keys, doors, and goal (models were created
          in Blender and exported as OBJs along with their texture
          coordinates, then run through a script)
        </li>
        <li>
          Load models in OBJ format (sort of - need to use the conversion
          script <code>tools/obj_parser.py</code>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

      <h2 id="command-line">Command Line Arguments</h2>
      <p>The application accepts one command line argument:
          <code>[map_file]</code>: The map file to load objects from
      </p>

      <h2 id="interaction">Interaction</h2>
      <p>The following interactions are supported in this application:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>wasd / mouse:</strong> Move around</li>
        <li><strong>t:</strong> Lock/unlock camera from the floor</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
      <p>The most time-consuming challenges of this project have been:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Trying to design the framework (Rust)</li>
        <li>Idiomatic collisions</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Rust</h3>
      <p>
        Easily the most difficult thing about this project has been trying to
        create a graphics framework. I've been thinking about doing this for a
        long time, because I am extremely tired of copy-pasting OpenGL code
        from old projects. I did some research on Entity-Component-Systems,
        including reading several threads on the 
        <a href="http://entity-systems-wiki.t-machine.org/">Entity Systems
          Wiki</a>, and talking to
        <a href="https://liamtyler.github.io">Liam Tyler</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was able to implement a very simple component framework that object
        with components. However, I wasn't able to create anything much more
        advanced than that... I wanted to have a global framework object, but
        due to the limitations on Rust's borrowing system having global static
        objects is nearly impossible. Additionally, I wanted components to
        have a pointer to their owning object, but the Rust borrow checker
        also doesn't like this at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, I chose to give up the global framework and component
        pointers in favor of actually completing the assignment, so right now
        the "framework" is intertwined with Homework 4 specific code. In the
        future, I hope to rewrite this framework (probably several times, and
        maybe with some C++...) in order to get a better final product.
      </p>

      <h3>Collisions</h3>
      <p>
        Collisions didn't cause me nearly as much trouble as making the
        framework did, but I still struggled a bit with them. I ended up
        adding a list of acquired keys into the scene, and adding things to it
        whenever a collision with a key was detected. Collisions with the
        camera were detected using a simple cube collision algorithm, as shown
        in Figures 1 and 2.
