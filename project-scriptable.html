            <a href="https://bridger-herman.github.io/scriptable-game/">Play The
                Game!</a>

            <h2>Gameplay / Game Design</h2>

            <p>
            The game is based on a version of Sudoku - Colorku - where
            each number is represented by a physical colored token. The
            rules of Colorku are similar to Sudoku, in that there may only
            be one piece of each color per row, per column, and per 3x3
            box. The game disallows illegal moves by bouncing the tokens
            upward away from the board.
            </p>

            <p>
            Moves are made by clicking the mouse on 9x9 grid locations.
            The color of the current token is highlighted below the view
            of the game board, and the current color token can be changed
            by clicking the button for that particular color. Different
            boards can be loaded with JavaScript.
            </p>

            <h2>Animation: Design and Implementation</h2>

            <h3>Design</h3>

            <p>
            There are three main instances where animation is used in the
            game:
            <p>

            <ul>
                <li>Placing a token</li>
                <li>Rejecting a token</li>
                <li>Winning</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Placing a token</h4>
            <p>
            When the user clicks the mouse on a valid board location, the
            new token of the correct color stretches and flies into the
            scene. The token first stretches in the Z direction, flies to
            the target location, then squashes into place on the board.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./assets/project-scriptable-game/place.gif">
                <figcaption>Placing a valid token</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Rejecting a token</h4>
            <p>
            The animation for clicking on an invalid location is similar
            to that of the valid location, but instead of moving into
            place on the board, the token comes into view and is reflected
            away.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./assets/project-scriptable-game/bounce.gif">
                <figcaption>Placing an invalid token (rejection)</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Winning</h4>
            <p>
            The last animation is a 2D text spinning animation that is
            triggered when the game is complete.
            </p>

            </figure>

            <h3>Implementation</h3>

            <h4>Token Animations</h4>

            <p>
            Both token animations are accomplished with a series of
            keyframes. The keyframes are set dynamically via JavaScript
            components on each token's entity. Keyframes have a <em>t</em>
            value, and a transform at that <em>t</em>. GLM's
            <code>mix</code> function is used to interpolate vectors.
            Keyframes are stored as JavaScript objects. For
            example, a square can be transformed over a finite amount of
            time, with the following keyframes:
            <pre>
let keyframes = {
    0.0: Transform.identity(),
    0.5: Transform.trs(
        glm.vec3(0.5, 0.4, 0.0),
        glm.vec3(0.0, 0.0, 45.0),
        glm.vec3(1.0, 0.3, 1.0),
    ),
    1.0: Transform.trs(
        glm.vec3(0.3, 0.9, 0.0),
        glm.vec3(0.0, 0.0, 25.0),
        glm.vec3(1.0, 1.0, 1.0),
    ),
};
            </pre>
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="./assets/project-scriptable-game/basic-keyframes.png">
                <figcaption>Square transformation defined by
                    <code>keyframes</code> object above</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Winning Animation</h4>

            <p>
            The winning animation is a simple CSS transformation, applied
            over 2 seconds:
            <pre>
#win-text {
    /* ... */
    animation: spin 2s;
}
@keyframes spin {
    from {transform: rotate(359.0deg);}
    to {transform: rotate(0.0deg);}
}
            </pre>
            </p>

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>
            The game does its best to stay faithful to the original 
            <a href="http://colorku.com/">Colorku</a>, which in turn follows
            Sudoku rules. There must be only one instance of each color in
            row, column, and 3x3 box. The winning state is achieved when all
            rows and columns have been filled, and none of the aforementioned
            conditions have been violated.
            </p>

            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>
            For this assignment, I created a (mostly proof-of-concept)
            rendering system for WebAssembly, with an integrated
            JavaScript scripting interface. At a high level, the engine
            works according to the following table and diagram:
            </p>

            <h4>JS and Wasm Setup Responsibilities</h4>
            <table border="1">
                <tr>
                    <th>WebAssembly</th>
                    <th>JS</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Compile shaders</td>
                    <td>Load scene from JSON</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Break down obj files into components for WebGL</td>
                    <td>Load all obj meshes from scene</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Initialize VAOs and VBOs for meshes</td>
                    <td>Initialize transforms</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Initialize rendering system</td>
                    <td>Initialize scripts and register them with Wasm</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td></td>
                    <td>Call <code>start()</code> for each script</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>
            During the setup process, a scene is loaded asynchronously
            from the server. Scenes define prefab objects that can be
            used throughout the scene. Each prefab can have a mesh
            associated with it, and must have at least one script attached
            to it. Scripts are attached to prefabs using their class names
            as strings. Scenes then provide a list of entities in the
            scene, which are identified by their prefab, color, and
            transform.
            </p>

            <p>
            The scene manager instructs the WebAssembly engine to create
            entities for those it finds in the scene file, and attaches
            scripts and transforms to the entities accordingly.
            </p>


            <h4>JS and Wasm Per-Frame Responsibilities</h4>

            <figure>
                <img src="./assets/project-scriptable-game/update-pipeline.png">
                <figcaption>The update pipeline between WebAssembly and
                    JavaScript</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
            The WebAssembly code triggers a timer interrupt at a frequency set by
            the user (the target frame rate, set via
            <code>setInterval</code>). Each frame, the WebAssembly updates
            the browser tab title with the current <em>dt</em>, then
            proceeds to call the update function for each of the scripts.
            WebAssembly has the capability to call JavaScript functions
            and methods directly, which I utilized by creating one base
            class (<code>WreScript</code>, a similar concept to Unity's
            <code>MonoBehaviour</code>). Each user script inherits from
            <code>WreScript</code>, and must define <code>start()</code>
            and <code>update()</code> methods. For example, the
            <code>start()</code> method in the <code>WreScript</code>
            derivative <code>BoardManager</code> takes care of
            programmatically instantiating all of the tokens from a
            particular puzzle onto the board.
            </p>

            <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>

            <p>
            The most difficult and time consuming part of the project was
            correctly passing data and control between the WebAssembly and
            the JavaScript sides. There are several parts of the engine
            that are quite hacked-together at the moment, and are likely
            quite slow (no benchmarks have been run as yet).
            </p>

            <p>
            If given a few more weeks to work on this, I would like to
            polish the interface between the JS and Wasm (particularly in
            regards to managing each entity's transform). Additionally, I
            would like to support rendering features expected of any
            engine, such as textures, normal maps, and more realistic
            lighting.
            </p>
