    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The goal of this assignment was to create a particle system to help with
    the following four simulations: A ball bouncing on a floor, a water fountain,
    a fire, and fireworks. We did those, as well as a smoke simulation.</p>
  
    <h2>Difficulties</h2>
    <p>We had about four main difficulties during the course of this project. The
    first was getting the balls to be normal mapped, and calculating where the
    depth of the fragment should be. Next was having transparent particles and
    blending them properly in order. This was a pain, because only some of the
    particles had to be sorted, some needed different blending modes, and the
    drawing order mattered. After that we had many bugs with the emitters. Lastly,
    getting all of the different types of particles to be on the screen
    simultaneously was difficult because we had to redo a lot of our structure.
    Overall it was a challenging project, most of it not related to the actual
    particle system, but how to draw it.</p>

    <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
    <p>Our system in general worked as following every frame:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Update the particles on the CPU. This would be updating the particle's
        position, velocity, age, and any other relevant data. Delete the old
        (dead) particles in this stage.</li>
        <li>Stream the data that is relevant for drawing the particles to the
        GPU.</li>
        <li>Draw the particles.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To further describe each simulation:</p>
    <p><strong>Bouncing Balls: </strong>All of our particles are billboarded
    quads. To make the quads seem like actual spheres though, we used normal
    mapping to get the correct lighting for each fragment. We also recalcuated the
    depth of the fragments so that intersecting spheres look correct. These are
    fully opaque, and rendered first.</p>
    <p><strong>Water: </strong>For water, and all of the following particles, we
    used textured billboards. For water we used the same texture as the smoke, but
    used the particle's color (a light blue) to differentiate them. The blending
    we did was regular blending with the current color * alpha + new color * (1 -
    alpha). We sorted these particles, and rendered them last.</p>
    <p><strong>Fire: </strong>Fire was interesting. We used a fire texture, and
    used the particle's age to look up its color in a color map which went from
    white-yellow, to red-black. We also used additive blending, to get the center
    of our fire to be 'white hot'. We also gave each fire particle a random
    rotation, and all fire shrinks and fades out of existance as it nears the end
    of its life. We rendered these after after the opaque objects, without
    sorting, but without writing to the depth buffer.</p>
    <p><strong>Smoke: </strong>Very similar to water, except that the color was
    grey. Each smoke particle also gets bigger and faded as it gets older, so
    simulate smoke dispersing. Sorted and rendered with water.</p>
    <p><strong>Fireworks: </strong>We created another particle which we called
    'sparkle'. It uses a different texture, and its color changes over time. A
    firework object goes upwards, emitting a trail of sparkles and smoke until it
    detonates. Then two spheres of different colored sparkles are emitted, as well
    as smoke. These sparkles pop in luminosity initially, and then flicker
    throughout their life. They don't really fade out like smoke or fire does. We
    sort and render these with water.</p>
  
    <p>We also implemented several other features:</p>
    <p><strong>Game Objects: </strong>In order to make testing the particle
    systems easier, we created Game Object primitives which can interact with the
    particles. The two types of game objects we created were spheres and
    planes</p>
    <p><strong>Collisions: </strong>We have two modes of collisions. The first is
    naive, and only checks for collisions on the ground plane. The second is much
    slower, but linearly checks for collisions with artibrary game objects, and
    has friction with the collided object. Sphere collisions use a simple check to
    see if particles are within the sphere's radius. Plane collisions are slightly
    more complicated, and use an adaptation of the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6ller%E2%80%93Trumbore_intersection_algorithm">M&ouml;ller-Trumbore
    intersection algorithm</a> for triangles.</p>
    <p><strong>Textured Quads: </strong>As mentioned previously, every particle is
    a textured quad. A sample of the some of the textures used can be found below.
    All textures except the normal map and colormap were created by the authors
    using GIMP.</p>

    </ul>
  
    <h2>Thread Parallel Performance</h2>
    <p>We later used OpenMP to help with the updating of the particles.
    To do this however, we had to change our implementation. If a
    particle's age is past its lifetime, we delete it bu just moving the
    last particle in the array into the now dead particle's spot. The
    problem with this, is that it cannot be done in parallel. So with
    OpenMP we switched it so that when a particle should be deleted, it
    adds the particle to a locked list, but does not delete it yet.
    After the updates, the deleting is done with one thread. Here were
    our results:</p>
    <img src="./assets/project-particles/parallel.jpg">
    <p>We were initially confused as to why we got no performance
    benefit. We figured out that it is due to two reasons: Caching, and
    the locked array. The locked array is obviously going to slow it
    down a little, but there aren't that many deletes per frame, so it
    doesn't explain everything. The rest is explained by our particle
    class having many attributes, so each particle is ~90 bytes. If we
    try to have hundreds of thousands of particles, we end up having a
    huge array. This means a lot of cache misses using multiple threads,
    and if we have not that many particles, it hardly matters whether
    you have parallelization or not. If we had used the 'struct of
    arrays' approach, instead of our 'array of structs', we would
    probably see improvement here.</p>
  
    <h2>Benchmarks</h2>
    <p>Since we had two collision methods as described above, we
    benchmarked each simulation except for fireworks with both collision
    methods. For each simulation, we recorded how many particles
    (actively emitting) we could reach before dropping below 30 FPS.
    Here are the results:</p>
    <img src="./assets/project-particles/benchmarks.jpg">
    <p>As you can see, the non-naive collisions are much slower. In
    general, the balls and fire are much faster as well, most likely
    because they don't have to be sorted. Even though the FPS drops down
    to ~20 with one million particles, we thought it was cool, so here
    are two images of that:</p>
