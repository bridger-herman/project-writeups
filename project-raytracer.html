        Tracing</h1>

        <h2>NOTE: I ported this to WebAssembly! Check out the web browser
          version of the ray tracer
          <a href="https://bridger-herman.github.io/wasm-raytracer">here</a>!</h2>

        <p>The goal of this project is to create a simple ray casting program
        that can draw spheres and triangles with shading, reflections, and
        refractions.</p>

        <h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
        <p>The most time-consuming challenges of this project have been:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Refractions</li>
            <li>Casting rays from the eye through the image plane</li>
            <li>Getting the right light intensities</li>
            <li>Creating the GUI</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>
          Refractions
        </h3>
        <p>
          Overall, the most difficult part of this assignment was definitely the
          refractions. I had a lot of small bugs throughout my code that showed
          up prominently when I worked on refraction. I'm still not convinced my
          implementation is 100% correct, becuase the results look close but
          there's still something out of place in some instances.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Ray casting
        </h3>
        <p>
            Honestly, the most difficult part (for ray casting) was getting
            the rays to go the right direction out of the eye. I spent a
            significant amount of time working on this, including coming up
            with some Mathematica visualizations to make sure the rays were
            going the correct directions and looked like a real camera
            frustrum. I thought I had it right for a long time...  and then
            once I tried to render some of the scenes that there were given
            sample images for. It turns out I had forgotten to convert to
            radians for my camera half-angle, which was leading to very
            bizzare reactions when that variable changed.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Light intensities
        </h3>
        <p>
            For a while, my light calculations were all resulting in an extremely
            bright image. It turned out that I was clamping my colors, but then
            multiplying by a extra factor in the diffuse component of the light
            calculation.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Creating the GUI
        </h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Warning:</strong> the GUI will break if you supply a
            different resolution from the one you loaded the application with.
            I feel like every homework so far, at least one of my challenges
            has been Rust-related... just the pains of using a relatively new
            language I suppose. This time, I had trouble because there really
            aren't many good GUI toolkits for Rust. The one I used (<a
                href="https://crates.io/crates/conrod">conrod</a>) is pretty
            massive, and requires a significant amount of boilerplate to even
            render a simple canvas. Additionally, it forces the use of a
                particular graphics framework (<a
                    href="https://crates.io/crates/glium">glium</a>), which I
                am not too fond of. If I were to start this part again, I
                would probably generate Rust bindings for Nanogui or some
                other C++ GUI library.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also tried to add more activity to the GUI (such as displaying the
          rendering progress and moving the camera around), but I ran out of
          time so I wasn't able to.
        </p>

        <h2 id="implementation-details">Implementation Details</h2>
        <p>This project is implemented in pure <a
            href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a>, and contains a custom
        Vector struct authored by me, since the use of GLM was strongly
        discouraged. </p>
        <p>The source code can be viewed on <a
        href="https://github.umn.edu/herma582/raytracer-5607">GitHub</a>. A zip file

        <p>The following libraries (crates) were used:</p>

          <li> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/conrod">conrod</a> (Graphics,
              windowing, and GUI components) </li>

              loading/saving) </li>

              parsing) </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="video">Video</h2>
        <p>For some reason, everything is brighter in the GUI on Mac. Also I
        added a tiny sphere to the shadow test scene so don't be alarmed by
        that.</p>
